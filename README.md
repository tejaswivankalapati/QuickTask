# ✅ QuickTask — A Smart To-Do App (Frontend-Only)

**QuickTask** is a sleek and simple to-do list app built using **HTML + CSS + JavaScript** only — no backend, no frameworks, no database.  
All data is stored locally in your browser using `localStorage`, so your tasks stay safe even after refreshing!

- ✅ Mark tasks as completed (with strike-through)

- 🌓 Dark / light mode toggle  
- 📂 Filter tasks: **All | Active | Completed**

- 🔔 **Desktop notifications** for due tasks using the Notification API
